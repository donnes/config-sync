# Roadmap

## Upcoming Features

### Cross-Platform Support

- [ ] **Windows Compatibility** - Full Windows support for all sync operations, including proper path handling, registry-based configs, and Windows-specific AI agent installations.

### Skills & Commands

- [ ] **Vercel-Style Skill Addition** - Streamlined workflow for adding new skills/commands to your agents. Drop in a markdown file, and syncode handles the rest—no manual config editing required.

- [ ] **Universal Skill Format** - Single source of truth for skills, commands, and agent configurations. Write once in canonical format, automatically convert to Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, VSCode, and any other AI agent's syntax. No more maintaining the same skill across multiple formats.

### Automation

- [ ] **Auto-Push on Changes** - Automatically commit and push config changes to your remote repository when modifications are detected. Keep your configs synced across machines without manual git operations.
